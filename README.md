# About

Welcome to the metro-wsit project.



This is the codebase and IssueTracker for Web Services Interoperability Technologies (WSIT) (previously known as Project Tango). It includes implementations of:

* WS-Trust
* WS-SecureConversation
* WS-SecurityPolicy
* WS-ReliableMessaging
* WS-AtomicTransactions/Coordination
* WS-MetadataExchange
* SOAP over TCP

Note:
* WS-Policy (github.com/javaee/policy) has its own code base but issues may be submitted in WSIT issue tracker.
* XML Web Services Security project has been merged into the WSIT code base

WSIT is delivered as part of the Metro Web Services Stack. Please go to the [Metro web site](https://javaee.github.io/metro) for downloads, documentation, etc. Here you find "Overview" (PDF) and another Shorter overview article.

All of Metro (including WSIT) is tested for interoperability between the Java platform and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) (aka Indigo) in .NET 3.0 and .NET 3.5. (Listen to what Microsoft has to say about interop with Project Tango in this Server Side interview.)
