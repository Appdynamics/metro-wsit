WSAT1001_DUPLICATE_ASSERTION_IN_POLICY = WSAT1001: Duplicate 'ATAssertion' policy assertions in a single policy alternative detected: {0}
WSAT1002_ADD_AT_POLICY_ASSERTION = WSAT1002: Adding WS-AT policy to to WSDL-bound operation ''{0}'':''{1}'', backed by web method ''{2}''.''{3}'' with effective TransactionFlowType ''{4}'' and EJB Transaction attribute ''{5}'':\n''{6}''
WSAT1003_INCOMPATIBLE_FEATURES_DETECTED = WSAT1003: Incompatible features produced by policy: ''{0}''
WSAT1004_ENDPOINT_AND_OPERATION_POLICIES_DONT_MATCH = WSAT1004: WS-AT policies for endpoint policy key ''{0}'' and operation policy key ''{1}'' are incompatible
