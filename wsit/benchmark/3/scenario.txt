Mutual X509 Certificate Authentication, Sign Encrypt, Use Derived Keys
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[WSS1.1] SOAP 1.2 message, Similar to previous scenario, but instead of using the same encrypted 
key directly for the primary signature and encryption, use symmetric keys derived from K. That is, 
Client and Server X509 certs are used for client and server auth respectively. Request is signed 
using DKT1(K), then encrypted using a DKT2(K), K is ephemeral key protected for Server's Cert. 
Signature corresponding to DKT1(K) is signed using client cert. Response is signed using DKT3(K), 
(if needed) encrypted using DKT4(K)
