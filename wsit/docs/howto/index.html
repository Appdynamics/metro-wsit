<h1>Getting Started with WSIT</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This series of articles intended to familiarize
developers with Sun's Web Services Interoperability Technologies
(<a href="http://wsit.dev.java.net">WSIT</a>). WSIT aims to ensure
interoperability of enterprise features
such as security, optimized communication, reliable messaging, and
atomic transactions. WSIT is being developed as an open source
project and
is part of the <a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish
Community</a>. The WSIT functionality plugs into Sun's <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxws/index.jsp">JAX-WS</a>
implementation, and its implementation code is at <a
 href="http://wsit.dev.java.net/">http://wsit.dev.java.net</a>.<br>
<h2><a href="http://wsit.dev.java.net/">Downloading, Building, and
Installing WSIT</a></h2>
This first article shows you how to retrieve the WSIT sources
from the <span style="font-family: monospace;">java.net</span> CVS
repository, how to build them, and then how to
install the resulting artifacts into your web container.
<h2><a href="http://wsit.dev.java.net/">Building a JAX-WS Application
in the WSIT Environment</a></h2>
The intent of this second article is to demonstrate the steps required
to build a
JAX-WS 2.0 web service starting both from Java code and from a WSDL
document, to deploy that application into a web container, and to
build a corresponding web service client application. In this
example, no WSIT-specific technologies will be enabled. It is
intended as a baseline from which to develop your understanding of
the larger WSIT environment.<br>
