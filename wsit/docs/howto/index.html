<h1>Getting Started with WSIT</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Sun's Web Services Interoperability Technologies project, <a href="http://wsit.dev.java.net">WSIT</a>,
aims to ensure interoperability of enterprise features such as security, 
optimized communication, reliable
messaging, and atomic transactions with Microsoft's Windows Communication Framework (WCF).
WSIT is being developed as an open source
project and
is part of the <a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish
Community</a>. The WSIT functionality plugs into Sun's <a
 href="http://jax-ws.dev.java.net">JAX-WS</a>
implementation, and its implementation code is at <a
 href="http://wsit.dev.java.net/">http://wsit.dev.java.net</a>.<br>
<h2><a href="WSIT_Download_Build_Install.html">Downloading, Building,
and
Installing WSIT</a></h2>
This first article shows you how to retrieve the WSIT sources
from the <span style="font-family: monospace;">java.net</span> CVS
repository, how to build them, and then how to
install the resulting artifacts into your web container.
<h2><a href="WSIT_Not_Enabled_Example.html">Building a JAX-WS
Application
in the WSIT Environment</a></h2>
The intent of this second article is to demonstrate the steps required
to build a
JAX-WS 2.0 web service starting both from Java code and from a WSDL
document, to deploy that application into a web container, and to
build a corresponding web service client application. In this
example, no WSIT-specific technologies will be enabled. It is
intended as a baseline from which to develop your understanding of
the larger WSIT environment.<br>
<h2><a href="WSIT_Enabled_Example.html">Enabling WSIT Functionality in
a Web Service Application</a></h2>
This article highlights the steps required to enable
WSIT functionality in a web service and its corresponding client
application. As with the previous article, two accompanying code
samples are included. Again, one starts from Java source code and the
other from an existing WSDL document to develop their respective web
services.&nbsp; However, this article and its code samples show how
WS-Policy can used to enable WS-Addressing and WS-Reliable Messaging in
the web services and their clients.<br>
