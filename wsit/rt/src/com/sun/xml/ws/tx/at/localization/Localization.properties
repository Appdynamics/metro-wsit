WSAT1001_DUPLICATE_ASSERTION_IN_POLICY = WSAT1001: {0} duplicate 'ATAssertion' policy assertions in a single policy alternative detected
WSRM1002_INCONSISTENCIES_IN_POLICY=WSRM1002: Inconsistency detected in a WS-Policy expression:\n \
[ {0} ] assertion is not compatible with WS-AtomicTransaction version [ {1} ].\n \
Please, update your WS-Policy expression by replacing current assertion with the assertions compatible \
with the used WS-AtomicTransaction  version. Note that future Metro release may decide reject such inconsistent \
policies and fail to deploy your web service.

WSAT1101_NON_EE_CONTAINER = WSAT1101: Running in a non Java EE container; disable mapping of Container Managed Transaction EJB to WS-AT Policy assertions due to ''{0}''
WSAT1102_ADD_AT_POLICY_ASSERTION = WSAT1102: Map CMT EJB web method ''{4}''.''{5}'' with effective transaction attribute of ''{3}'' to wsdl bounded operation ''{0}'':''{1}'' with WS-AT policy assertion(s) ''{2}''
